- <div> is a block-level element. It starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
- <span> is an inline element. It does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

Example:
<div>this is div</div>
<span>this is span</span>

Difference between <div> and <span>:

1. <div>
   - Block-level element.
   - Starts on a new line and stretches out to the full width available.
   - Used to group larger sections of content or elements.

     <div style="background-color: lightblue;">This is a div block</div>

2. <span>
   - Inline element.
   - Does not start on a new line; only takes up as much width as its content.
   - Used to style or group small portions of text or inline elements.
   - Example:
